    "text": "I’m Sara — a veterinarian by training, an epidemiologist by passion, and an explorer at heart.\nBorn in Portugal but with a spirit that never settled, I’ve always been drawn to the connections between science, animals, and the world around us. What began as a love for veterinary medicine quickly grew into a broader goal: understanding how populations move, how diseases spread, and how everything connects in an increasingly globalized world.\nSince discovering epidemiology, I’ve been chasing questions that move populations — particularly animals but not only. In an era where disease travels faster than ever, population medicine and spatial epidemiology are not just fields of study; they are ongoing challenges across borders, species, and ecosystems.\nConnecting the dots — between species, spaces, and people — is at the core of what I do."
