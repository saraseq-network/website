What now? The igraph R package makes our life simple.\n\nIgraph is a library and R package for network analysis, providing a pain-free implementation of graph algorithms and fast handling of large graphs that have millions of nodes and edges. By using this package, we create a special object of class “IGRAPH”.\n\nFor example:\n\nlibrary(igraph)\ng &lt;- graph_from_edgelist(\n  matrix(c(\"A\",\"B\",\"B\",\"C\",\"C\",\"A\"), ncol=2, byrow=TRUE),\n  directed = TRUE) \ng\n\nIGRAPH e892929 DN-- 3 3 -- \n+ attr: name (v/c)\n+ edges from e892929 (vertex names):\n[1] A-&gt;B B-&gt;C C-&gt;A\n\nclass(g)\n\n[1] \"igraph\"\n\nis.simple(g)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n# Let's visualize the network!\nplot(g)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# How many nodes/vertices does it have?\nV(g)\n\n+ 3/3 vertices, named, from e892929:\n[1] A B C\n\n# How many edges?\nE(g)\n\n+ 3/3 edges from e892929 (vertex names):\n[1] A-&gt;B B-&gt;C C-&gt;A\n\n\n\nIgraph assumes, by default, that our network is directed. If we want to explicitly set it as undirected:\n\ng_undirected &lt;- graph_from_edgelist(\n  matrix(c(\"A\",\"B\",\"B\",\"C\",\"C\",\"A\"), ncol=2, byrow=TRUE),\n  directed = FALSE) \nplot(g_undirected)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(igraph)\ng &lt;- graph_from_data_frame(\n  d = edges, \n  vertices = nodes,   # your node list with attributes\n  directed = TRUE)\n\nplot(g,\n  layout = layout_with_fr(g),\n  vertex.size = 8,\n  vertex.label = NA,\n  edge.arrow.size = 0.3,\n  edge.color = \"grey40\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that we’ve visualized our animal movement network, the next step is to quantify its structure with a five simple statistics:\n\n\nTotal number of nodes (premises) and edges (movements) in the network.\n\nHow many premises and movements do we observe?\n\n\n# How many nodes/vertices does it have?\nV(g)\nvcount(g) \n\n# How many edges?\nE(g)\necount(g)    \n\n\n\n\nProportion of actual edges to the maximum possible edges.\n\nHow “connected” is our system compared to a fully connected network?\n\n\nedge_density(g, loops = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\nThe number of subgroups of nodes where everyone is connected directly or indirectly.\n\nAre there isolated clusters of premises not linked to the rest?\n\n\ncomponents(g, mode = \"weak\")$no  # number of weakly connected components\ncomponents(g, mode = \"strong\")$no  # number of strongly connected components\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipCheck-in question:\n\n\n\n\nWhy is the number of weakly connected components different than the strongly connected components?\n\n\n\nCode\nplot(g,\n  layout = layout_with_fr(g),\n  vertex.size = 8,\n  vertex.label = NA,\n  vertex.color = components(g, mode = \"strong\")$membership,  # each component gets its own color\n  edge.arrow.size = 0.3,\n  edge.color = \"grey40\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiameter is the single longest shortest path between any two nodes (i.e., informs about the extent of a possible disease outbreak), while the Average Path Length is the mean of all shortest paths (i.e., informs the mean distance an outbreak would reach).\n\nOn average, how many steps separate one premises from another? What about the maximum distance?\n\n\nmean_distance(g, directed = FALSE)\ndiameter(g, directed = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\nProbability that two connected nodes’ neighbors are also connected. I will be zero if there are no triangles, or 1 if all neighbors of nodes connect to each other.\n\nDo we see “triangles” (tight local clusters) in our network?\n\n\ntransitivity(g, type = \"global\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also calculate measures that capture some more general notion of ‘importance’ of a node - typically referred to as node/vertex centrality measures. Some of them include degree (in-degree, out-degree or total degree), weighted degree or strength (in-strength, out-strength or total strength), closeness and betweenness centrality.\n\n\nWhat is the degree in this network, as represented in the graph?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    River Beef Ranch       Pioneer Dealer        County Market \n                   8                   23                   25 \n     Prairie Feedlot      Blue Beef Ranch         North Dealer \n                  17                    8                   26 \n           Oak Dairy         Metro Market         Mesa Feedlot \n                   8                   24                   19 \n     Vista Slaughter         South Dealer  Sunrise Calf Raiser \n                  14                   25                   15 \n      Central Market          Green Dairy    Harvest Slaughter \n                  26                    8                   14 \n       Valley Raiser Hillside Calf Raiser           Lake Dairy \n                  17                   17                    9 \n         Maple Dairy     Cedar Beef Ranch \n                   9                    8 \n\n\n\n\nInstead of simply counting the number of edges (degree), we can account for the magnitude of movements by summing up the edge weights:\n\n# Total animals moved (in + out)\nV(g)$strength_animals_total &lt;- strength(g, mode = \"all\", weights = E(g)$animals)\n\n# Total shipments moved (in + out)\nE(g)$weight &lt;- E(g)$shipments\n\nOnce we defined our weights, we can visualize it!\n\n# Plot scaled by total animals moved\nplot(g,\n  layout = layout_with_fr(g),\n  vertex.size = scales::rescale(V(g)$strength_animals_total, to = c(2,30)),\n  vertex.label = NA,\n  edge.width  = scales::rescale(E(g)$weight, to = c(0.01, 4)),\n  edge.arrow.size = 0.3,\n  edge.color = \"grey40\",\n  main = \"Node size scaled by total animals moved (imports + exports)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt already tells us way more information about the role of premises in the network, right?

Think of these nodes as shortcuts in the network - surveillance at these nodes might help us detect diseases earlier, since they are more central in terms of reach.\n\n\n# Compute closeness (ignore direction; unweighted)\nV(g)$closeness &lt;- closeness(g, mode = \"all\", weights = NA, normalized = TRUE)\n\n# Simple plot: size by closeness, color by type\nplot(g,\n  layout       = layout_with_fr(g),\n  vertex.size  = scales::rescale(V(g)$closeness, to = c(6, 34)),\n  vertex.color = V(g)$color,\n  vertex.label = NA,\n  edge.width   = scales::rescale(E(g)$weight %||% 1, to = c(0.2, 4)),\n  edge.arrow.size = 0.20,\n  edge.color   = \"grey65\",\n  main         = \"Closeness centrality (undirected)\")\n\nlegend(\"topright\", legend = names(pal), col = pal, pch = 19, bty = \"n\", cex = 0.8)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipCheck-in questions:\n\n\n\n\nWho are the highest closeness centrality nodes?\n\n\n\nCode\n# top 3 nodes tip\nV(g)$name[order(V(g)$closeness, decreasing = TRUE)[1:3]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBetweenness centrality, as the name indicates, measures the extent to which a node lies on paths between other nodes.\n\n\n\n\n\nNodes have high betweeness if they are in a position to observe or control the “flow of information” in the network.\n\n*What does that mean practically?* Premises with high betweenness centrality act like bridges or brokers. They don’t necessarily move the most animals, but they sit on the shortest paths between other premises, meaning they can control or facilitate the flow of animals (and pathogens) between otherwise weakly connected parts of the system. Targeting high-betweenness nodes (e.g., through biosecurity campaigns or movement restrictions) can interrupt transmission routes more effectively than focusing on large volume sites.\n\n\n# Compute betweenness (often undirected for animal networks)\nV(g)$betweenness &lt;- betweenness(g, directed = FALSE, weights = NA, normalized = TRUE)\n\n# Visualize\nplot(g,\n  layout       = layout_with_fr(g),\n  vertex.size  = scales::rescale(V(g)$betweenness, to = c(6, 34)),\n  vertex.color = V(g)$color,\n  vertex.label = NA,\n  edge.width   = scales::rescale(E(g)$weight %||% 1, to = c(0.2, 4)),\n  edge.arrow.size = 0.20,\n  edge.color   = \"grey65\",\n  main         = \"Betweenness centrality (undirected)\")\n\nlegend(\"topright\", legend = names(pal), col = pal, pch = 19, bty = \"n\", cex = 0.8)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipCheck-in questions:\n\n\n\n\nWho are the highest betweenness centrality nodes?\n\n\n\nCode\n# top 3 nodes\nV(g)$name[order(V(g)$betweenness, decreasing = TRUE)[1:3]]"

If we want to explicitly set it as undirected:\n\ng_undirected &lt;- graph_from_edgelist(\n  matrix(c(\"A\",\"B\",\"B\",\"C\",\"C\",\"A\"), ncol=2, byrow=TRUE),\n  directed = FALSE) \nplot(g_undirected)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(igraph)\ng &lt;- graph_from_data_frame(\n  d = edges, \n  vertices = nodes,   # your node list with attributes\n  directed = TRUE)\n\nplot(g,\n  layout = layout_with_fr(g),\n  vertex.size = 8,\n  vertex.label = NA,\n  edge.arrow.size = 0.3,\n  edge.color = \"grey40\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that we’ve visualized our animal movement network, the next step is to quantify its structure with a five simple statistics:\n\n\nTotal number of nodes (premises) and edges (movements) in the network.\n\nHow many premises and movements do we observe?\n\n\n# How many nodes/vertices does it have?\nV(g)\nvcount(g) \n\n# How many edges?\nE(g)\necount(g)    \n\n\n\n\nProportion of actual edges to the maximum possible edges.\n\nHow “connected” is our system compared to a fully connected network?\n\n\nedge_density(g, loops = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\nThe number of subgroups of nodes where everyone is connected directly or indirectly.\n\nAre there isolated clusters of premises not linked to the rest?\n\n\ncomponents(g, mode = \"weak\")$no  # number of weakly connected components\ncomponents(g, mode = \"strong\")$no  # number of strongly connected components\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipCheck-in question:\n\n\n\n\nWhy is the number of weakly connected components different than the strongly connected components?\n\n\n\nCode\nplot(g,\n  layout = layout_with_fr(g),\n  vertex.size = 8,\n  vertex.label = NA,\n  vertex.color = components(g, mode = \"strong\")$membership,  # each component gets its own color\n  edge.arrow.size = 0.3,\n  edge.color = \"grey40\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiameter is the single longest shortest path between any two nodes (i.e., informs about the extent of a possible disease outbreak), while the Average Path Length is the mean of all shortest paths (i.e., informs the mean distance an outbreak would reach).\n\nOn average, how many steps separate one premises from another? What about the maximum distance?\n\n\nmean_distance(g, directed = FALSE)\ndiameter(g, directed = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\nProbability that two connected nodes’ neighbors are also connected. I will be zero if there are no triangles, or 1 if all neighbors of nodes connect to each other.\n\nDo we see “triangles” (tight local clusters) in our network?\n\n\ntransitivity(g, type = \"global\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also calculate measures that capture some more general notion of ‘importance’ of a node - typically referred to as node/vertex centrality measures. Some of them include degree (in-degree, out-degree or total degree), weighted degree or strength (in-strength, out-strength or total strength), closeness and betweenness centrality.\n\n\nWhat is the degree in this network, as represented in the graph?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    River Beef Ranch       Pioneer Dealer        County Market \n                   8                   23                   25 \n     Prairie Feedlot      Blue Beef Ranch         North Dealer \n                  17                    8                   26 \n           Oak Dairy         Metro Market         Mesa Feedlot \n                   8                   24                   19 \n     Vista Slaughter         South Dealer  Sunrise Calf Raiser \n                  14                   25                   15 \n      Central Market          Green Dairy    Harvest Slaughter \n                  26                    8                   14 \n       Valley Raiser Hillside Calf Raiser           Lake Dairy \n                  17                   17                    9 \n         Maple Dairy     Cedar Beef Ranch \n                   9                    8 \n\n\n\n\nInstead of simply counting the number of edges (degree), we can account for the magnitude of movements by summing up the edge weights:\n\n# Total animals moved (in + out)\nV(g)$strength_animals_total &lt;- strength(g, mode = \"all\", weights = E(g)$animals)\n\n# Total shipments moved (in + out)\nE(g)$weight &lt;- E(g)$shipments\n\nOnce we defined our weights, we can visualize it!\n\n# Plot scaled by total animals moved\nplot(g,\n  layout = layout_with_fr(g),\n  vertex.size = scales::rescale(V(g)$strength_animals_total, to = c(2,30)),\n  vertex.label = NA,\n  edge.width  = scales::rescale(E(g)$weight, to = c(0.01, 4)),\n  edge.arrow.size = 0.3,\n  edge.color = \"grey40\",\n  main = \"Node size scaled by total animals moved (imports + exports)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt already tells us way more information about the role of premises in the network, right?

Think of these nodes as shortcuts in the network - surveillance at these nodes might help us detect diseases earlier, since they are more central in terms of reach.\n\n\n# Compute closeness (ignore direction; unweighted)\nV(g)$closeness &lt;- closeness(g, mode = \"all\", weights = NA, normalized = TRUE)\n\n# Simple plot: size by closeness, color by type\nplot(g,\n  layout       = layout_with_fr(g),\n  vertex.size  = scales::rescale(V(g)$closeness, to = c(6, 34)),\n  vertex.color = V(g)$color,\n  vertex.label = NA,\n  edge.width   = scales::rescale(E(g)$weight %||% 1, to = c(0.2, 4)),\n  edge.arrow.size = 0.20,\n  edge.color   = \"grey65\",\n  main         = \"Closeness centrality (undirected)\")\n\nlegend(\"topright\", legend = names(pal), col = pal, pch = 19, bty = \"n\", cex = 0.8)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipCheck-in questions:\n\n\n\n\nWho are the highest closeness centrality nodes?\n\n\n\nCode\n# top 3 nodes tip\nV(g)$name[order(V(g)$closeness, decreasing = TRUE)[1:3]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBetweenness centrality, as the name indicates, measures the extent to which a node lies on paths between other nodes.\n\n\n\n\n\nNodes have high betweeness if they are in a position to observe or control the “flow of information” in the network.\n\n*What does that mean practically?* Premises with high betweenness centrality act like bridges or brokers. They don’t necessarily move the most animals, but they sit on the shortest paths between other premises, meaning they can control or facilitate the flow of animals (and pathogens) between otherwise weakly connected parts of the system. Targeting high-betweenness nodes (e.g., through biosecurity campaigns or movement restrictions) can interrupt transmission routes more effectively than focusing on large volume sites.\n\n\n# Compute betweenness (often undirected for animal networks)\nV(g)$betweenness &lt;- betweenness(g, directed = FALSE, weights = NA, normalized = TRUE)\n\n# Visualize\nplot(g,\n  layout       = layout_with_fr(g),\n  vertex.size  = scales::rescale(V(g)$betweenness, to = c(6, 34)),\n  vertex.color = V(g)$color,\n  vertex.label = NA,\n  edge.width   = scales::rescale(E(g)$weight %||% 1, to = c(0.2, 4)),\n  edge.arrow.size = 0.20,\n  edge.color   = \"grey65\",\n  main         = \"Betweenness centrality (undirected)\")\n\nlegend(\"topright\", legend = names(pal), col = pal, pch = 19, bty = \"n\", cex = 0.8)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipCheck-in questions:\n\n\n\n\nWho are the highest betweenness centrality nodes?\n\n\n\nCode\n# top 3 nodes\nV(g)$name[order(V(g)$betweenness, decreasing = TRUE)[1:3]]"

Both would work, I chose tibble as it allows for better plots (ggplot) and summaries further - while a matrix could be good if you only need raw speed and numeric precision."
