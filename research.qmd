::: research-intro
One of the greatest things about my job is how international and interdisciplinary it can be. During my career journey, I was fortunate to work with amazing teams across the globe, and with different livestock production systems.

As part of my PhD, I am using cattle movement records to characterize **US calf movement networks** and **build a mathematical simulation model of *S.* Dublin spread in the US**; Using both within- and between-zip code dynamics, this tool will help us define targeted biosecurity measures and structure-aware movement interventions.

We’re building a **vehicle–facility contact network** from GPS entries across swine operations in a brazilian production system. By implementing a monitoring system for vehicles/people movements across agricultural sites, we can **identify "super-spreader" farms** and allow a more targeted monitoring. Our team will also **track compliance by visits and flag high-risk movements**. Are these originated from high-centrality facilities?

This project is about to start (exciting!!) and consists in a large nation-wide survey to **map and characterize management practices in US livestock markets**; Our team is focused on **identifying practical disease risk-reduction measures** in U.S. markets.

Live bird markets (LBMs) have been associated with infectious disease risks. Live bird shops (LBSs) are more common in India. However, its role in pathogen transmission remains understudied. This Gujarat-based project investigated typical **LBSs practices** and assessed **their potential for pathogen entry and exposure to chickens and humans**.
