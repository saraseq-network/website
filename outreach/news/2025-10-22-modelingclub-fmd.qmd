# Background

Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a severe, fast-spreading viral disease that primarily affects cloven-hoofed animals, including cows, pigs, sheep, goats, and deer, leading to considerable economic losses worldwide. 
As such, defining targeted FMD surveillance and control strategies becomes essential to prevent  ... An affordable way to understand FMD spread and explore intervention alternatives is to use mathematical and simulation modelling.

> This Quarto document is a hands-on, incremental build of an FMD model: from a minimal SIR to SEIR, then adding controls (culling, vaccination), stochasticity, and a simple multi-farm extension. Each section includes exercises and checklists you can run during the session.
