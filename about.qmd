I’m **Sara** — a veterinarian by training, an epidemiologist by passion, and an explorer at heart.

Born in Portugal but with a spirit that never settled, I’ve always been drawn to the connections between science, animals, and the world around us. What began as a love for veterinary medicine quickly grew into a broader goal: understanding how populations move, how diseases spread, and how everything connects in an increasingly globalized world.

Since discovering epidemiology, I’ve been chasing questions that move populations — particularly animals but not only. In an era where disease travels faster than ever, population medicine and spatial epidemiology are not just fields of study; they are ongoing challenges across borders, species, and ecosystems.

**Connecting the dots** — between species, spaces, and people — is at the core of what I do.

## Beyond the lab
If I’m not debugging a model, I’m probably behind a camera, petting a dog, hunting good coffee, or outside running/hiking. I love cities with ocean light and neighborhoods with great markets.
